		Creates a minimal configuration for use alongside <a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/">M2E: Maven Integration for Eclipse</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>N.B.: This configuration cannot be used to create a full bnd-based toolchain for OSGi development</b>, therefore certain
		advanced features such as incremental builds, semantic versioning and baselining will be missing. Rather, it is intended
		for Maven users who want to take advantage of Bndtools' runtime and resolution features only.
