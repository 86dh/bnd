CnfSetupCreateTitle=Create Bnd Configuration Project
CnfSetupCreateExplanation=\
	Bndtools uses a configuration project "cnf" to store its local bundle repository and shared build \
	settings. It is recommended to create this and initialise the repository with a set of basic bundles.\n\
	\n\
	If this is not done, certain Bnd features such as multi-project builds and repository \
	management will be unavailable.
