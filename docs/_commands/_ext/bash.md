## Bash Command Autocompletion

The `bash` command in bnd can generate an autocompletion script for the Bash shell, making it easier to use bnd commands interactively.

When you run the bash autocompletion generator, bnd will create a temporary file containing the autocompletion script, populate it with the list of available commands, and output the result. This script can then be sourced in your shell to enable tab-completion for bnd commands.

**Example:**

To generate and use the autocompletion script for bash:

1. Run the following command to generate the script:
   ```
   bnd bash > bnd-completion.bash
   ```
2. Source the script in your shell:
   ```
   source bnd-completion.bash
   ```

This will enable tab-completion for all available bnd commands in your current shell session.
