# Tool

The `Tool` header in the bundle manifest indicates the version of bnd that was used to build the bundle. This is automatically set by bnd during the build process and helps with tracking, debugging, and auditing builds.

The value is typically in the form:

```
Tool: Bnd-7.0.0
```

This header is set by bnd and should not be manually changed.
