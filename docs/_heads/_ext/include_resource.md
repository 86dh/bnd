# Include-Resource

The `Include-Resource` header (or instruction) allows you to include additional files, directories, or archives in your bundle. This is useful for packaging configuration files, documentation, or other resources alongside your code.

See the documentation for [`-includeresource`](../instructions/includeresource.html) for details and usage examples.
