The `-runprogramargs` instruction allows you to specify additional arguments that will be passed to the main program when it is launched. These arguments are appended to the command line after all other options and can be used to control the behavior of your application at runtime.

This is useful for providing custom parameters, flags, or configuration values to your application without modifying the code or build process.
