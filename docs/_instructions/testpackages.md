<!-- Manual content from: ext/testpackages.md --><br /><br />

The `-testpackages` instruction allows you to specify which packages should be included as test packages in your project. You provide a comma-separated list of package specifications, and bnd will treat these packages as containing test code.

This is useful for projects that separate test code into specific packages or want to control which packages are considered for testing, especially when running or packaging tests.
