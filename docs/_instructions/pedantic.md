When setting this instruction to `true` there will be more warnings about *things that are not really wrong but still not right*.
It can be helpful to fix problems in your workspace.

**Note for Eclipse users:** Currently a change to this instruction requires a restart of Eclipse. The Refresh-Workspace button is not enough.
