summary:  Additional arguments for the VM invocation. Arguments are added as-is.
---


The `-runvm` instruction allows you to specify additional arguments that will be passed directly to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when launching your application. These arguments are added as-is to the command line and can be used to set system properties, enable debugging, adjust memory settings, or configure other JVM options.

This is useful for customizing the runtime environment of your application without modifying the code or build process.
