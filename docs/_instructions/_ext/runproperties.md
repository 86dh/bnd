summary:  Define system properties for the remote VM.
---

The `-runproperties` instruction allows you to define system properties that will be set for the remote Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when your application is launched. These properties are passed as `-Dkey=value` arguments and can be used to configure the runtime environment, control application behavior, or provide configuration values.

This is useful for setting environment-specific options or overriding default values without modifying your application's code.
