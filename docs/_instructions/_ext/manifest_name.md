summary:  Set the resource path to the manifest, for certain standards the manifest has a different name.

The `-manifest-name` instruction allows you to set a custom resource path for the manifest file in your JAR. By default, the manifest is stored as `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`, but some standards or environments may require a different name or location.

Use this instruction to override the default manifest path when needed. For example, you might set it to a different file name or directory to comply with a specific packaging requirement.
