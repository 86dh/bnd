# -strict

The `-strict` instruction enables extra verification during the build process. When set to `true`, bnd performs additional checks and validation to ensure the highest quality and correctness of the bundle.

Example:

```
-strict: true
```

This is useful for enforcing stricter build requirements and catching potential issues early.
