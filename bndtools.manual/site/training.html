		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>This 4-day workshop will provide delegates with an excellent baseline grasp of OSGi technology, from the fundamentals through to advanced and enterprise topics and is delivered by renowned OSGi developer, consultant and trainer Neil Bartlett.</p>

		<p>On day one, you will be introduced to OSGi and learn how it meets the challenge of building modular, scalable application architectures for the Java Platform. We will review the three principal open source implementations and then dive into the construction of modules, learning how to define dependencies between them and manage versions of APIs.</p>

		<p>Next you'll move onto OSGi Services, the lynchpin of OSGi's programming model and the key to creating flexible, reusable components. You will use the Declarative Services (DS) specification to build components that react to their environment, configure themselves dynamically and interact with other components. Then you will look at one of the most important patterns used in constructing real applications using services, namely the "Whiteboard Pattern".</p>
