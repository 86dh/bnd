The new release contains several powerful new features that did not appear in early betas, such as:

* "OBR Everywhere".
* Automatic Semantic Versioning.
* New, faster and more stable project builder.
* Build-time package dependencies.
* Bnd editor syntax highlighting and completion.

Head over to [What's New in Bndtools Version 1.0.0](/whatsnew1-0-0/) for more details of these features.

Bndtools can be installed from the [Eclipse Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/bndtools), or see the [Installation Instructions](/installation.html) for other methods.

A [tutorial](/tutorial.html) is available. We would love to see more tutorials from community members, so please [let us know](mailto:njbartlett@gmail.com) if you have blogged about Bndtools and we will add a link back to you.
