The site and docs are built with Hakyll and Pandoc, which are libraries
written in Haskell. Hakyll is similar to the Ruby-based Jekyll.

There are two ways to setup your development environment. Either install
Haskell and the required libraries directly on your computer as follows:

1. Install the Haskell Platform (http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/)
2. Install Hakyll: `cabal install hakyll` (this will take a long time).

Alternatively, use the supplied Vagrant descriptor to isolate all the
Haskell dependencies inside a VM:

1. Install Vagrant (vagrantup.com) and a VM manager, e.g. VirtualBox.
2. From the current directory, run `vagrant up` (this will take a long
time to provision to box) followed by `vagrant ssh`.
3. Inside the VM, change to the directory `/vagrant`. This is linked to
the current directory in the host machine.

To build the site:
==================

$ rm -r out
$ ./generate.sh


To test the site:
=================

$ ./serve.sh
$ open http://localhost:8000/
